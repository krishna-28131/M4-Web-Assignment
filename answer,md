# Web Application – Basic Concepts

## Q1. Role of Frontend (FE)

Frontend is the part of a web application that the user directly sees and uses. It focuses on how the application looks and how users interact with it.

### User Interface

* Frontend is responsible for designing the layout of the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* It controls buttons, forms, text, images, colors, and overall page structure.
* A good frontend makes the website attractive, clean, and easy to understand.

### User Interaction

* Frontend handles all user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, scrolling pages, and typing data.
* It gives quick responses to users, such as showing error messages or loading animations.
* It improves user experience by making the application smooth and responsive.

### Communication with Backend

* Frontend sends requests to the backend to get or send data.
* It uses APIs and HTTP/HTTPS for communication.
* Frontend only displays data and never directly accesses the database.

## Q2. Role of Backend (BE)

Backend is the server-side part of a web application. It works behind the scenes and handles all logic, data, and security-related tasks.

### Server-Side Processing

* Backend receives requests from the frontend and processes them.
* It applies rules, validations, and calculations based on application needs.
* After processing, it sends the correct response back to the frontend.

### Database Handling

* Backend connects with the database to store and retrieve data.
* It manages user data, product details, orders, and other information.
* Direct database access is never given to users for security reasons.

### Security and Authentication

* Backend manages user login, signup, and authentication.
* It checks user permissions before allowing access to data.
* It protects the system from attacks like unauthorized access and data theft.

## Q3. Business Logic

Business Logic refers to the main rules of an application that decide how the system should work. It represents real-world business rules converted into software logic.

Business logic ensures that the application behaves correctly according to business requirements.

### Real-World Examples

1. **Online Shopping Website**

   * Calculating total price including discounts, tax, and delivery charges.
   * Allowing checkout only if products are available in stock.

2. **Banking Application**

   * Checking account balance before allowing money transfer.
   * Applying daily withdrawal limits and service charges.

3. **Online Exam System**

   * Allowing students to attempt exams only during a fixed time period.
   * Automatically calculating marks based on answers.

## Q4. Client–Server Model

The Client–Server Model is a system where work is divided between two parts: client and server. Both communicate with each other to run a web application.

### Client

* Client is usually a web browser or mobile application.
* It shows the user interface and collects user input.
* It sends requests to the server and displays the response.

### Server

* Server hosts the backend application.
* It processes client requests, applies business logic, and manages the database.
* It sends responses back to the client.

### Communication Process

* Communication happens through HTTP or HTTPS.
* Client sends a request and server sends a response.
* This request–response cycle continues until the task is completed.

```
Client  →  Request  →  Server
Client  ←  Response ←  Server
```

## Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

Three-Tier Architecture is a common design pattern used in web applications. It divides the application into three separate layers.

### Presentation Layer

* This is the frontend layer.
* It handles user interface and user interaction.
* Examples include web pages and mobile app screens.

### Application (Business) Layer

* This layer contains business logic.
* It processes data and applies rules.
* It connects the presentation layer with the data layer.

### Data Layer

* This layer handles data storage.
* It includes databases and data access logic.
* It ensures data is stored securely.

### Why Three-Tier Architecture is Used

* Makes the application easier to maintain.
* Improves scalability and performance.
* Enhances security by separating concerns.

## Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language

JavaScript is widely used as a backend language because it is fast, flexible, and has a large developer community.

### Performance

* JavaScript follows an event-driven and non-blocking approach.
* It handles multiple requests efficiently.
* Suitable for real-time applications like chat apps.

### Ecosystem

* JavaScript has a huge ecosystem with many ready-to-use libraries.
* Developers can use the same language for frontend and backend.
* This reduces development time and effort.

### Popular Backend Frameworks

* **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
* **Express.js** – Simple and flexible backend framework.
* **NestJS** – Used for large and structured applications.

JavaScript helps in building fast, scalable, and modern web applications.
